Difference between http1 & http2

Request-Response Model: 
The request-response model used by HTTP/1 stipulates that each request and response must be sent over a separate connection. Contrarily, HTTP/2 minimises latency by enabling the simultaneous transmission of numerous requests and responses over a single connection.

Compression of headers: 
HTTP/1 provides headers as plain text with each request and response, causing redundant data transfer. By using header compression, HTTP/2 greatly lowers overhead and boosts performance.


Multiplexing: 
If a prior request or response is still being processed, subsequent requests will be delayed due to head-of-line blocking in HTTP/1. With the addition of multiplexing in HTTP/2, head-of-line blocking is eliminated, concurrent requests and responses are made possible inside a single connection, and overall performance is enhanced.

Server Push:
 Server Push is a feature of HTTP/2 that enables the server to transfer resources to the client without waiting for explicit requests. By reducing the number of additional round trips, this function speeds up page loads.

Prioritisation:
 Stream prioritisation is supported by HTTP/2, giving clients the ability to prioritise requests. This enables the prioritisation of essential resources, resulting in faster delivery and a better user experience.

Binary Protocol:
 HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol, which is more effective for data transmission and parsing than HTTP/1, which uses a text-based protocol.

TLS Encryption: 
Although not unique to HTTP/2, HTTP/2 encourages and extensively adopts the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, enhancing security and privacy.
